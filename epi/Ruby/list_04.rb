Reverse sublists k at a time
Write a function which takes as input a singly linked list L and a nonnegative
integer k, and reverses the list k nodes at a time. If the number of nodes n in
the node is not a multiple of k, leave the last n mod k nodes unchanged. Do
this using O(1) additional memory, and do not change the data stored within
a node.
