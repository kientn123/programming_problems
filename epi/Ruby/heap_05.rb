You want to compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. The sequence
is presented to you in a streaming fashion. You cannot back up to read an
earlier value, and you need to output the median after reading in each new
element

Design an algorithm for computing the running median of a sequence. The time
complexity should be O( logn ) per element read in, where n is the number
of values read in up to that element.
