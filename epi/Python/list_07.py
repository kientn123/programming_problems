# Test for overlapping lists - Lists may have cycles
# If such node exists, return a node that appears first when traversing the
# lists. This node may not be unique - If L1 has a cycle with n0 as the first
# node in the cycle when traversing L1, then L2 may have the same cycle but
# a different first node.
